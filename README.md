Creating a coding quiz application

## Introduction

Created a simple web-based coding quiz application where users can test their knowledge on Javascript within a time limit. Time will be deducted for each incorrect answer. For each correct answer the user will get a score of 10. Once the quiz ends, the users are able to save and view the highscore on the leader board.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on the "Start Quiz" button to begin the quiz.
3. Answer each question within the time limit.
4. View your final score and enter your initials to save your score.
5. To view the highest scores, click on the "View Highscores" link at the top of the quiz page.
